\section{Highlights}

%%Research highlights
\begin{itemize}
\item Mode of the non-central chi-squared distribution has linear asymptotic approximation.
\item Iterative scheme can be continued beyond the linear approximation for the mode.
\item Initial guess for the Boost C++ library algorithm for the mode was improved.
\end{itemize}
